## Microservices Spring Start
Project developed as a Spring Boot microservice designed to manage customer account creation, leveraging an H2 in-memory database for development and testing purposes. The application provides a RESTful API at /api/v1/accounts for customer registration, accepting a CustomerDTO as input. Upon receiving a request, it checks for existing customers by phone number using CustomerRepo, and throws a custom CustomerAlreadyExistsException if a duplicate is detected. When a new customer is created, a corresponding bank account is automatically generated and persisted with default settings such as account type and branch address, using AccountRepo. The system follows a layered architecture, separating DTOs, mappers, services, repositories, and entities for maintainability. Entity auditing is enabled using Spring Data JPA's auditing system, with support for tracking createdAt, createdBy, updatedAt, and updatedBy fields automatically via annotations like @CreatedDate and @LastModifiedBy. A custom implementation of AuditorAware (AuditAwareImpl) is used to define the auditing context. Centralized exception handling is implemented with @ControllerAdvice to return structured error responses. Validation of required input fields is handled through @NotBlank annotations on DTO properties. The application also enables the H2 console for easy DB inspection during development, and logs all SQL statements for transparency and debugging.
