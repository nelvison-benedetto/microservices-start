## Microservices Spring Start
Project developed as a Spring Boot microservice to manage customer account creation, leveraging an H2 in-memory database for development and testing. It provides RESTful APIs at /api/v1/accounts to register, update, fetch, and delete customer data, accepting a CustomerDTO as input. Upon registration, the system checks for existing customers by phone number and throws a custom CustomerAlreadyExistsException if a match is found. If the customer is new, an associated account is automatically created with default settings (e.g., account type and branch address) and a randomly generated 10-digit account number.

The architecture follows a clean separation of concerns using DTOs, mappers, services, repositories, and entities. Input validation is enforced using annotations such as @NotBlank and @Pattern on DTO fields. Auditing is handled by Spring Data JPA using annotations like @CreatedDate and @LastModifiedBy, with a custom AuditorAwareImpl to define the context. Centralized error handling is implemented with @ControllerAdvice for structured exception responses. SQL statements are logged for debugging, and the H2 console is enabled for convenient in-browser DB inspection.

REST API documentation is integrated using Springdoc OpenAPI 3. All endpoints are annotated with @Operation, @ApiResponse(s), and related OpenAPI metadata. A Swagger UI is available at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html for testing and exploration of all exposed endpoints, including detailed request/response schemas.
